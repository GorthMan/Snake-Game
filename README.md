# Snake-Game
Remake of the classic game "snake" made using C#.  Objects in the game are rendered using characters and letters on a terminal.  The way that the game works is that the player controls the "snake" which is represented by "X"s.  This snake can move in four directions and is always moving.  The snake can turn in any direction except for whichever direction is opposite to the direction it is currently going.  If the snake hits itself or the side of the level,represented by "#", the game is over.  The game also randomly spawns in "apples", represented by an "@", for the snake to eat in the map.  If the snake runs over an apple, it will "eat" it and grow by a size of 1.  The goal of the game is to collect as many apples as you can and acheive a high score, where 1 score is gained when an apple is eaten.  This game also features a very rudementary window where you start or exit the game.
